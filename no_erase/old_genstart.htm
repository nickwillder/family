<P>This site is also for exchanging information about the genealogy of the 
Willder family name. It was inspired by Ray Willder of Nantwich, Cheshire, UK 
who has, over 60 years, rigorously researched and catalogued over a thousand Willders dating back to around 1500. I (<A HREF="mailto:nick@willder.net">Nick&nbsp;Willder</A>) have transcribed a good deal of the basic data into computer readable form so that Ray's research can live forever.</P>
<P>You can add people and families on-line, right now, <A HREF="add.html">here</A>.</P>
<P>There is a standard computer file format for genealogical information called GEDCOM. Whilst family tree and genealogical computer programs store their data in their own proprietary format, all can import and export GEDCOM data. Such programs are readily available from computer stores, off magazine cover discs, and by downloading from the 'Net. The current Willder GEDCOM file can be downloaded 
(see link at top of page). Even if you do not have access to a genealogical program the file can be read with a simple text editor.</P>
<P>I heartily recommend Kith &amp; Kin by <A href="http://www.spansoft.org/">Spansoft</A>. The current Willder Kith &amp; Kin 
'TRE' file can be downloaded (see link at top of page).</P>
