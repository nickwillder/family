My father was Horace Willder, an only child so we thought, but you have him with a sister Ivy Gertrude born 1907.<br/>
I have checked on Ancestry and you are correct.<br/>
But there is only one female in the house on the 1911 census and gran didn't die until1955.<br/>
She then re appears and marries in 1939 and has two sons with Emlyn Harries.<br/>
Confusion deepens when I find an Ivy Wilder of exactly the right age on a boat from Montreal with her father John Edwin, Mother Gertrude and brother Norman Wilder. (One L). In 1912 showing her as four and a half.<br/>
Can't link the two families and it seems such a coincidence.<br/>
Dad never ever mentioned a sister, yet she appears to have lived and died in Bham, apart from the boat thing (if this is her?)<br/>
The only relation ever mentioned was a cousin who was a vicar.<br/>
And I have found a Rev John Wilder. But how can he be a cousin? Grandad was an only child.<br/>
How can I solve this?<br/>
By the way Horace had 3 sons, who in turn have had three sons and one of those has a son, so lots more Willders carrying on...<br/>
