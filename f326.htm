Dava writes (presumably quoting her mother):<br/>
Jim’s former boss Elliott bought a ranch in Alberta and asked Jim to move out there to work for him. <br/>
While they lived in Western Canada, Jeannie Louise was born Sept. 12th, 1914.  Since the nearest doctor lived 20 miles away in a Hamlet called Didsbury, there was no time to go for him by horse and buggy.  It was up to Jim to act as a mid wife.  He had a booklet on midwifery that had come with a medical book which Mary had bought and paid $8.00 for.  At the time Jim had chided Mary and told her she had more money than brains.  He changed his story that day as he used the booklet that came with the medical book which gave him step by step instructions on how to deliver a baby. I (my mother Nettaline Willder) can recall him saying how nervous he was when he had to cut the umbilical cord.  I imagine he ate his words many times as that book came in handy often during a crisis.<br/>
