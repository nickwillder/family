I remember Raymond’s visit to 13 Burton Road,  Melton Mowbray in the 1950’s/1960’s to see my Aunt Sarah Wilhelmina Willder.<br/>
I did attend university in Edinburgh [but didn't marry].<br/>
I lived with Aunt Sarah from 1950  It was only very short distance from where my parents lived and it was considered that I would be company for her as well as relieving the pressure on my parents dealing with my three brothers. It was a considerable benefit to me – certainly as far as school work was concerned. I continued to live with Aunt Sarah until her death in 1978. I continued as a bachelor for some years after her death and then married for the first time in December 1984.<br/>
I taught Mathematics at the same Grammar School in Leicester from 1963 until retirement on December 31st 2005. On 1st January 2006 – 65th birthday I was included in the New Year’s Honours List – awarded MBE for ‘services to further education in the City of Leicester’. A very pleasant retirement/birthday present.<br/>
