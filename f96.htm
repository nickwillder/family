Ray Willder P81 says:<br/>
In practice, Nottingham 1970<br/>
19 Russley Green, Wokingham 1972<br/>
595 Russell Court, Woburn Place, London WC1  0171 837 9005 (Dr. S. Willder in phone book 1996 could be Simon)<br/>
Russell Court is right by the British Medical Association - Does S work here?<br/>
Nick Willder P75 (Me) says:<br/>
James in Bath (P343) once saw an S. Willder on a rowing trophy in Oxford (University).<br/>
Jack Willder corrects Ray's assumption that Simon was a Doctor of Medicine. His PhD was Particle Physics. I'm unsure who Jack is. Jack Jeffrey P821 seems unlikely. Jack emailed from dbis.edu.hk on 05 Aug 2018.<br/>
Simon isn't hard to find on the Internet. Keble College (Oxford) pub. 'The Record 2017/18&quot; carries Simon's obituary:<br/>
Simon Shelton Willder (1967) died in July 2018 aged 75. He graduated from University College London with a BSc in Physics (1964) and came up to Keble for a DPhil in Physics (1970). Already an international rower, he rowed in the Keble Eight which became Head of the River (1968) and for the University. He became a member of both the Institute of Physics and the Institute of Electrical Engineers and later both a Chartered Physicist and a Chartered Engineer. He joined the Plessey Company as a Software Manager and rose to become Managing Director of the company (1970–83). He moved to Standard Telephones and Cables as Technical Director (1983–86). His last appointment was as Managing Director of Racal Communications Systems Ltd and Deputy Managing Director of Racal Radio Group. He was also Chairman of Racal Canada Incorporated (1987–98). After he retired, he did some part-time consultancy work. He published several articles in scientific journals. He was awarded the Order of Independence (First Class) by King Hussain of Jordan. Simon was married twice: Joan and he had three sons James, Henry and Jonathon; and then in 1987 he married Annie. <br/>
