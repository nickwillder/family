Evelyn's daughter is Sue. She wrote to me (Nick P75) on 03 Oct 2009 as follows. I am attempting to incorporate Sue's notes into this GEDCOM. (Nick 2022)<br/>
Dear Nick,<br/>
my name is Susan Wolstenholme, my mother was Evelyn Willder<br/>
daughter to Joseph Willder and Robina Henderson, I am writing with some<br/>
information that may fill some gaps and correct some of the confusion in<br/>
your Willder tree. From my research it would appear that there were no<br/>
Willders (Wilders Willdens!!!! whatever ) living on the Fylde coast before<br/>
the arrival of my Gt grandfather Samuel who came to the Fylde some time<br/>
before the 1881 Census. Presumeably this is how he met Jane Moss as she was<br/>
born in Lytham yet they married in Bury. Despite the males born, there seems<br/>
to be suprisingly few Willders in the area even now. I hope this is not too<br/>
difficult to follow. I will no doubt be able to help further as I dig<br/>
deeper, but for now some you know some you don't but it helps with<br/>
clarity.......<br/>
Sarah Wilder c1838 b Ashbourne<br/>
married Thomas Taylorc 1839 Bury<br/>
Mary 1863 Bury<br/>
Elizabeth Ellen 1865<br/>
Clara 1869<br/>
Betsy 1872<br/>
Thomas 1883<br/>
James c1832 b Bury<br/>
married 2Q 1854 8c 462 Bury  Margaret parkinson c 1835 b Bury<br/>
William Willder c1853 I believe he was something of an alchoholic and<br/>
possibly a rogue!<br/>
married Susan Baker c1857 in 1874<br/>
? Herbert 1877 died 1877<br/>
Alice Jane c1879 b Bury married William Osbaldeston c 1878 b Farnworth in<br/>
1900 Fylde alice dies 1908 leaving one daughter Florence c1906<br/>
James 19.5.1882 died 1959 in Canada Married Mary Dundas Harrigan<br/>
?Maggie (Need to prove this is Williams daughter) c1883 b Bury married 1909<br/>
Fylde  to Ernest Frederick Jowett<br/>
Mary Annie 1885 1Q Preston 8e 647 married Richard de Melville Reath 3.3.1909<br/>
in Elgin Ontario<br/>
Edith Annie c 1887 Died 1925 in Canada Ontario married Fred (James) Gould in<br/>
1912 Fylde<br/>
?Maude c1888<br/>
May Mabel 1889 b Blackpool (see below)<br/>
After the death of Susan, William married Ellen Rangeley in 1891 2Q fylde 8e<br/>
970 (nee Wilkinson)who dies 1894 Without Issue?<br/>
then not Jane ? as on your site but<br/>
Elizabeth Newman (nee Bentley) aged 38 22.10.1894 in Blackpool William<br/>
refers to hiself as a Batchelor on the marriage cert.But no question it is<br/>
him, father James Cab prop. Witnessed by Edward Gaskell and Alice Jane<br/>
Willder, his daughter. only months after the death of Ellen (Eleanor)<br/>
However Elizabeth Willder aged 64 then remarries to Thomas Gray 17.9.1919<br/>
stating that she is a widow. Do I assume that she was divorced from William<br/>
as you have him dying in Bury in 1940? Do you have access to this death<br/>
certificate or a reference?<br/>
Also to explain PHYLLIS MARY WILLDER<br/>
Williams daughter May Mabel born 1889 gave birth to Phyllis Mary 2.12.1907<br/>
illigitimately. Phyllis appears in the 1911 Census as the adopted daughter<br/>
of John Robert Brown and Etty or Betty Brown living in Ardwick Manchester<br/>
with Sarah Elizabeth Brown Mother-in-law 'Certified Midwife' !!<br/>
May Mabel later marries Albert Clark and has 5 children Bertha M c1912,<br/>
Albert c.1914, Edward T c 1916,  Dora c1917 and George 1919,<br/>
May's husband Albert dies in France at Flanders in 1918<br/>
She then marries Matthew Winder in 1919 in Salford, now known to them as<br/>
Mabel May there are no children from this union.<br/>
Samuel Willder 1861 b Bury Cab driver, labourer and chimney sweep and also<br/>
had donkeys on the beach for tourists. Cannot understand why he should have<br/>
died in Manchester as the family home was still 5 Cross Street, which was<br/>
only sold after the death of Robina in 1986<br/>

Hilda M Willder b1913 married Joseph H Moss<br/>
James 1891 is living in Lytham as a boarder in the 1911 Census working as a<br/>
Stoker. Don't know what happened to him?<br/>
You have James as a chimney sweep of 5 Cross Street St Annes, however I know<br/>
that my grandfather Joseph was a chimney sweep at this address in the late<br/>
50's and for many years after He died at this address.<br/>
Samuel married again to Jane Turner ( nee Fisher )c1864 born Lytham Jane had<br/>
