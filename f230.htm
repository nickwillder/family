Date of death probably wrong. Ray presumably found a William d.1940, but not this one?<br/>
Cab driver, 15 Grundy Street, Bury, Lancs 1881<br/>
Presumed moved to Fylde with parents 1883/90<br/>
Presumed moved to Bury after 1921<br/>
Susan Wolstenhome writes (Oct 2009):<br/>
I believe he was something of an alchoholic and possibly a rogue!<br/>
Ray has his death in 1940. Susan doubts this, saying:<br/>
Elizabeth Willder aged 64 remarries to Thomas GRAY 17 Sep 1919 stating that she is a widow. Thus William must have died BEF 1920.<br/>

Elizabeth Newman (nee Bentley) aged 38 22.10.1894 in Blackpool<br/>
William refers to hiself as a Batchelor on the marriage cert. But no question it is him, father James Cab prop. Witnessed by Edward Gaskell and Alice Jane Willder, his daughter. only months after the death of Ellen (Eleanor).<br/>
