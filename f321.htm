Hello, Nick,   <br/>
I came across your WILLDER genealogy site .  On the site I see my husbands grandmother EDITH ANNIE WILLDER married FRED GOULD<br/>
1912 and came to Canada 1913. I can fill in information on their family. There were six children and two males still living 83 and 87 years.<br/>
If I could be of help please let me know.<br/>
Hope to hear from you.<br/>
Sharon Blain,<br/>

Nick, I was talking to Dava Robichaud last night as I just got my DNA results from ancestry.ca and found her on Facebook. It was quite fun finding out about her and her family. She told me about you and the research you’ve done in our family. I am a descendant of Edith Annie and Fred Gould. Fred was my father’s father. My dad, Wilbert was adopted by Joe Blain, hence my last name. Regardless, I can help you fill the entire tree of Fred and Edith Gould.<br/>
