Date of death probably wrong. Ray presumably found a William d.1940, but not this one?<br/>
Cab driver, 15 Grundy Street, Bury, Lancs 1881<br/>
Presumed moved to Fylde with parents 1883/90<br/>
Presumed moved to Bury after 1921<br/>
Susan Wolstenhome writes (Oct 2009):<br/>
I believe he was something of an alchoholic and possibly a rogue!<br/>
Ray has his death in 1940. Susan doubts this, saying:<br/>
Elizabeth Willder aged 64 remarries to Thomas GRAY 17 Sep 1919 stating that she is a widow. Thus William must have died BEF 1920.<br/>

According to Dava: Born May 19th, 1882 in Bury (recorded as 1881, but when he sent for his birth certificate, he discovered that he in fact was born in 1882). Dava refers to James Arthur, but Ray has no record of 'Arthur'. Query if this is same person. ?<br/>
Lineage of James courtesy of Dava Lynne.<br/>
Dava writes:<br/>
While James was still very young, his mother Susan died and his father remarried.  Since they were both alcoholics, Jim became undisciplined and unmanagable.  His two older sisters Maude &amp; Maggie tried to raise him but he kept running away.  He was then sent to the Dr. Bernardo's Home for Wayward Boy and Orphans (perhaps Blackpool). When he was 14 years of age, a Canadian farmer whose last name was Elliott from Melbourne, Ontario sponsored him and he was brought to Canada to work for him.<br/>
Dava writes:<br/>
The family moved to Chatham, Ontario in 1929.  James worked for the British Leaf Tobacco Company and had to quit due to health problems.  He then became Steward at the Royal Canadian Legion Branch 28 and worked there until his retirement in March of 1949.  <br/>
Jim died of pneumonia on December 20th, 1959.  He is interred at the Maple Leaf Cemetary, Chatham, Ontario, Canada.  Mary died on January 18th, 1972, and is buried beside her husband.<br/>

Dava writes:<br/>
While in Alberta, Jim joined the army.  We do not know the date, but judging by a picture that we have, I would say somewhere in the 1915's because Jeannie looked to be around 1 year old.  Mary had to come home to Ontario on a train by herself with her small brood.  I recall Evelyn saying how Jeannie cried most of the way home.  Mary was relieved by a kind lady who took Jeannie some of the time.<br/>
